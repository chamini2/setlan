### Implementation decisions
We chose Haskell for its powerful functional notation, and because of the
ease of use of the tools Alex and Happy.

### Current Status
The Parser and Lexer are working as expected. The scoper show only one error,

### Problems?
Show only one error on the scope

### Other comments
The output format is not identical to the one in the project statement, but the
infomation it presents is equivalent.
